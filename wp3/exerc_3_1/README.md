# Simple LED Light Program
### All code here is used for Arduino environment only

The code in both the `.c` and `.ino` files are the, just different file formats.

## Task:
Create a simple system in TinkerCad, which will use one LED to blink periodically, e.g. once a second. Add one 
more LED and a button. The second LED should be on when the button is pressed, and off, when the button is 
not pressed.  

NOTE: `exerc_3_1` can not run nor compile outside an arduino uno environment.
