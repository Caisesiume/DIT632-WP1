// LIBRARY TIMERONE

/*
 *  Interrupt and PWM utilities for 16 bit Timer1 on ATmega168/328
 *  Original code by Jesse Tane for http://labs.ideo.com August 2008
 *  Modified March 2009 by Jérôme Despatis and Jesse Tane for ATmega328 support
 *  Modified June 2009 by Michael Polli and Jesse Tane to fix a bug in setPeriod() which caused the timer to stop
 *  Modified June 2011 by Lex Talionis to add a function to read the timer
 *  Modified Oct 2011 by Andrew Richards to avoid certain problems:
 *  - Add (long) assignments and casts to TimerOne::read() to ensure calculations involving tmp, ICR1 and TCNT1 aren't truncated
 *  - Ensure 16 bit registers accesses are atomic - run with interrupts disabled when accessing
 *  - Remove global enable of interrupts (sei())- could be running within an interrupt routine)
 *  - Disable interrupts whilst TCTN1 == 0.  Datasheet vague on this, but experiment shows that overflow interrupt 
 *    flag gets set whilst TCNT1 == 0, resulting in a phantom interrupt.  Could just set to 1, but gets inaccurate
 *    at very short durations
 *  - startBottom() added to start counter at 0 and handle all interrupt enabling.
 *  - start() amended to enable interrupts
 *  - restart() amended to point at startBottom()
 * Modiied 7:26 PM Sunday, October 09, 2011 by Lex Talionis
 *  - renamed start() to resume() to reflect it's actual role
 *  - renamed startBottom() to start(). This breaks some old code that expects start to continue counting where it left off
